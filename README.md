            A quiet yet seismic shift is reshaping its housing markets once again—a shift driven by the inexorable
            growth of Airbnb listings. The complex interplay between the homestays and the housing economies has
            revealed negative effects that reverberate through surrounding neighborhoods. When cross-referenced with
            state laws, datasets from insideairbnb.com documenting Airbnb rental durations, pricing, neighborhoods,
            availability, and licenses in Los Angeles, uncovers an AirBnB property takeover. The socio-economic
            implications of the rising amount of home rentals and related evictions also reveals the financial strain of
            Angelenos in the wake of Airbnb&#39;s surge.

            The articles and data regarding Airbnb short and long-term rentals reveal that affordable units have been
            converted to short-term rentals and the low socioeconomic populations are suffering the most from this rapid
            change. Since economically advantaged individuals are incentivized and motivated to take part in becoming
            hosts by these big rental companies, such as Airbnb, there is an ever-increasing gap within the communities
            where listings are on the rise.

        <p class="the-rising-prices">
          The rising prices within the housing market are due to the increase in home rentals. Not only does it impact
          people within the city, but it also shows how the new, ‘local’ hospitality service factors into much bigger
          problems, such as gentrification. <br /><br />Our project delves into the online housing rental marketplace of
          Airbnb. Our dataset originates from Inside Airbnb, a site dedicated to documenting Airbnb listings and their
          impact in international cities and residential communities. The detailed CSV files provided by Inside Airbnb
          include detailed listings, reviews, and neighborhoods for each city and county. Our group chose to focus on
          Los Angeles County, as these issues pertain largely to our group, where the majority of us have lived in Los
          Angeles for more than 5 years.
        </p>
        <p class="text-wrapper-17">
          Our focus on the impact of Airbnb in Los Angeles is important in shedding light on this unprecedented event.
          By navigating the intricate interplay between Airbnb growth and housing economies, we aim to address how the
          city of Los Angeles should respond to the influx of Airbnb properties. Between higher rental costs and
          evictions, our project emphasizes the socio-economic gap between middle-to-lower class individuals and
          upper-class individuals capable of acquiring property. Ultimately, this project highlights the intricate
          socioeconomic dynamics that have always been prevalent in the Los Angeles area, that is now encroaching on the
          front doors of the working middle class. By contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of this urban
          phenomenon, our research extends beyond conventional narratives and aims to inform broader conversations about
          the evolving landscape of housing in metropolitan areas.
