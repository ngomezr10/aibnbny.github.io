# Airbnb Data Management Project

Welcome to the Airbnb Data Management Project, where we explore ways to effectively organize, analyze, and manage large-scale Airbnb data for insights and optimization.

## Project Overview

This project involves cleaning, structuring, and analyzing Airbnb data to optimize listings, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions. By leveraging machine learning, big data tools, and visualization techniques, we aim to provide valuable insights for Airbnb hosts and property managers.

### Key Details:
- **Data Source**: Airbnb dataset from Kaggle
- **Technologies**: Python, SQL, Tableau, Jupyter Notebooks
- **Focus Areas**: Pricing analysis, occupancy prediction, and review sentiment analysis

## Data Management

Efficient data management is crucial for obtaining accurate and actionable insights. Our data pipeline involves cleaning and transforming raw data from Airbnb listings, user reviews, and booking information into structured formats suitable for analysis.

### Key Steps in Data Management:
1. **Data Collection**: Collecting data from APIs, CSV files, and other sources.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and preprocessing the data.
3. **Data Storage**: Using PostgreSQL for data storage and retrieval.
4. **Data Transformation**: Creating meaningful features for analysis and machine learning models.

## Data Analysis

Through data analysis, we uncover actionable insights to improve Airbnb business decisions. Below are some of the key analyses performed in this project:

### Key Analyses:
- **Pricing Analysis**: Understanding how factors like location, property type, and amenities affect pricing.
- **Occupancy Forecasting**: Predicting occupancy rates based on historical data.
- **Sentiment Analysis of Reviews**: Analyzing user reviews to gauge customer satisfaction and identify trends.

We use Python libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Seaborn** for analysis. Additionally, **Tableau** is used for visualizing trends and key findings.
